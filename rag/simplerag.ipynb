In 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards the Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture and their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my FIRST VISION is that of FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.\\n\\nWe have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t this incorrect? MY SECOND VISION for India is DEVELOPMENT. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among top five nations in the world in terms of GDP.\\n\\nI have a THIRD VISION. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, of the Dept. of Space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life.\\n\\nI was in Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year-old girl asked me for my autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is. She replied: I want to live in a developed India. For her, you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim India is not an underdeveloped nation; it is a highly developed nation.\\n\\nYou say that our government is inefficient. You say that our laws are too old. You say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. You say that the phones don’t work, the railways are a joke, the airline is the worst in the world, and mails never reach their destination. You say that our country has been fed to the dogs and is the absolute pits. You say, say and say. What do you do about it?\\n\\nDear Indians, I am echoing J.F.Kennedy’s words to his fellow Americans to relate to Indians ……. “ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY.”')]"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Introduction\\nDesertiﬁcation is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas\\nprimarily caused by human activities and climatic variations [1]. It occurs because dryland\\necosystems, which cover over one-third of the world’s land area, are extremely vulner-\\nable to overexploitation and inappropriate land use [ 2]. As one of the most important\\nenvironment–economy–society problems of the world, desertiﬁcation threatens regional\\necological security and limits economic development at national levels, accompanying de-\\nclining soil fertility and vegetation degradation [3,4]. The UNCCD 2017 report showed that\\nsome 10–20% of drylands are already degraded, the total area affected by desertiﬁcation is\\nbetween 6 and 12 million km2, about 1–6% of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertiﬁed\\nareas, and one billion people are under threat from further desertiﬁcation [5].

By 2014, the area\\nof aeolian desertiﬁed land in northern China had reached 37.59 ×104 km2 and the land\\ndirectly affected by wind and sand disasters reached 166.9 ×104 km2 with 400 million\\npeople in 16 provinces affected and causing average annual losses of RMB 50 billion [6].\\nTherefore, it is necessary to accurately monitor the dynamic changes in desertiﬁed land to\\nunderstand the occurrence and development of desertiﬁcation and provide a framework\\nfor preventing desertiﬁcation in the future.\\nAlthough the biophysical processes of desertification at local scales have been researched\\nextensively via long-term investigation and monitoring of field stations [7–9], research about\\nthe spatio-temporal variability of large-scale desertiﬁcation is currently lacking and requires\\nfurther exploration. The development of remote sensing technology allows for long-term\\nand large-space studies to understand the evolution and driving mechanism of desertiﬁca-\\ntion [10–12]. Previous studies have obtained desertiﬁcation data by visual interpretation\\nbased on Landsat data [11,13]. Although the accuracy of the visual interpretation method\\nis high, it is time-consuming, laborious and expensive to monitor a large area. In addition,\\nthese analyses are inﬂuenced by subjective factors and require the interpreter to master the\\nspectral, spatial and temporal properties of the research objective and the geological laws\\nof ground objects.\\nAs image recognition and remote sensing technologies advanced, Qi et al. applied\\nsupervised classiﬁcation and other computer-automatic classiﬁcation methods to extract\\ndesertiﬁcation data based on Landsat images, accelerating the efﬁciency of desertiﬁcation\\ninformation acquisition [ 10]. However, the temporal resolution of desertiﬁcation data\\nobtained using Landsat data is low, limiting interpretations about the driving mechanism\\nof desertiﬁcation at large spatial scales. Xu et al. applied hyperspectral and low-medium\\nresolution images from MODIS for desertiﬁcation monitoring [ 14]. Most studies apply\\nvegetation indices (i.e., NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, etc.) that characterize vegetation information\\nas a proxy for desertiﬁcation [15–18]. However, these studies only use vegetation indices\\nand do not include information about soil the and surrounding environment, meaning\\nthat the accuracy of desertiﬁcation is limited. To address this, Wei et al. and Guo et al.\\nused multi-index monitoring to obtain desertiﬁcation information, and the results showed\\nthat this method effectively improved the monitoring accuracy [19,20]. Gradually, Albedo,\\nNDVI, LST, MSAVI and other indicators that characterize vegetation–soil–temperature\\ninformation were applied to monitor desertiﬁcation. Duan et al. obtained the spatial and\\ntemporal dataset of desertiﬁcation in Horqin Sandy Land in the past 15 years by using\\nmachine learning based on the decision tree and multi-index method [12]. Subsequently,\\nMunkhnasan et al. analyzed the spatial–temporal pattern of desertiﬁcation in the study\\narea by combining the TGSI index, representing topsoil information, with the analytic\\nhierarchy process [21].\\nThe development of machine learning methods has effectively promoted desertiﬁ-\\ncation classiﬁcation research. Among them, the decision tree (DT) is employed by many\\nacademics, and the classiﬁcation accuracy is excellent with an overall classiﬁcation accu-\\nracy exceeding 86.69% [12,22,23]. With the application of RF in image classiﬁcation, Fan\\net al. compared the classiﬁcation results of RF, CART and SVM with Landsat images in\\ndesertiﬁcation identiﬁcation. However, RF did not provide beneﬁts, and its classiﬁcation\\naccuracy was lower than that of CART [24]. Meng et al. compared the classiﬁcation effect\\nof RF and ﬁve other machine learning methods in desertiﬁcation at the same time, and the\\nclassiﬁcation accuracy was 90% [25]. Deep learning technology is currently widely used\\nin image classiﬁcation, particularly in the ﬁelds of land cover/land use, water and crop\\nmapping [26]. Nevertheless, it is still unknown in the application of multispectral remote\\nsensing desertiﬁcation monitoring, which is only used in hyperspectral remote sensing\\nat the local scale [ 27,28]. As a result, this study selected the CART, RF and CNN for a\\ncomparative study of desertiﬁcation classiﬁcations.\\nLarge-scale and multi-index remote sensing monitoring of desertiﬁcation has become\\na topical research direction and an important component of global land-surface process'),\n",

Since the 1960s, frequent agricultural and\\ngrazing activities have made the ecological environment of this area change, worsening the\\nproblem of desertiﬁcation [30,31]. In the 21st century, people continue to carry out ecological\\nrestoration activities led by the government, and desertiﬁcation has been gradually reversed\\nsince 2000 [32,33]. However, the problem of desertiﬁcation cannot be ignored, and studies\\nshow that desertiﬁcation still exists in some parts of Mu Us Sandy Land [34].\\nThe purpose of this study is to propose a feasible methodology that combines mul-\\ntiple remote sensing monitoring indicators and machine learning methods to obtain the\\noptimal combination of indicators and methods for desertiﬁcation monitoring. Speciﬁcally,\\n(1) to explore efﬁcient and accurate theoretical methods for regional-scale desertiﬁcation\\nmonitoring; (2) to provide a set of high precision and high time resolution desertiﬁcation\\ndatasets. This paper aims to improve desertiﬁcation research by developing monitoring\\nindicators and monitoring methods and to provide data basis for understanding the cause\\nand prevention of desertiﬁcation.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Study Area\\nThe Mu Us Sandy Land is located between 106◦26′–110◦55′E and 36◦48′–40◦12′N, and\\nincludes 11 banners (counties, districts) in most areas of Ordos City in Inner Mongolia\\nAutonomous Region, northern Yulin City in Shaanxi Province, and northeastern Ningxia\\nHui Autonomous Region, covering an area of approximately 87,353 km2 (Figure 1). This\\narea is located in the intermediate zone between the Ordos Plateau and the Loess Plateau\\nand is a transitional zone between wind erosion and water erosion following from sandy\\nto loess areas. The elevation ranges from 1000 to 1400 m, and the terrain slopes from\\nnorthwest to southeast [29]. Mu Us Sandy Land has a semi-arid climate that transitions\\nfrom temperate grassland to desert grassland and is the transition zone from animal\\nhusbandry to agriculture, which belongs to the typical temperate continental climate. The\\nannual average precipitation is 150–500 mm, decreasing from southeast to northwest. The\\nannual average temperature is 5.5–8.7 ◦C, the annual evapotranspiration is 2200–3000 mm,\\nand the annual average wind speed is 2.00–3.60 m·s−1 [29]. In the study area, both zonal\\nand non-zonal soil coexist. The zonal soil consists primarily of chestnut soil, while the\\nnon-zonal soil consists primarily of aeolian sandy soil, swamp soil, saline-alkali soil, and\\nmeadow soil. The vegetation is primarily grassland and sandy shrub vegetation, with\\nArtemisia ordosica as the dominant plant species [35]. Mu Us Sandy Land is one of China’s\\nfour major sand lands and a key component of the northern farming-pastoral ecotone. It is\\nsituated in a typical fragile ecological environment and is a signiﬁcant source of sediment\\nin the Yellow River. As a sensitive ecological transition zone in northern China, the Mu Us\\nSandy Land has always been an important region of desertiﬁcation research [36].'),\n",

In the classiﬁcation mode, RF uses an ensemble\\nclassiﬁcation with multiple classiﬁers and a fully non-parametric statistical method [ 47].\\nThere are hundreds of decision trees built into RF classiﬁcation, and their decisions are usu-\\nally combined by multiple votes. The general principle of group training is that ensemble\\nmodels are superior to single models, avoiding the clashes between feature subsets [48].\\nConsequently, the RF classiﬁcation is extensively used to process remote sensing imagery.\\nThe important training options in the RF model are the number of trees, the maximum\\nnumber of features in RF splitting, and the variant for the sampling process [49]. Following\\nthe results of the experiments, the maximum number of trees used in this study was set to\\n100, and this study selected the square root of the total feature as the maximum number of\\nfeatures, which concerns the best splitting scenario. Additionally, the out-of-pocket (OOB)\\nsample statistics are used in this model. When new input is used, the OOB sample statistics\\ndetermine how the model will be implemented. This model was run using the package\\nRandom Forest in Python version 2.7 software [50].\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\\nCNN is a deep neural network originally designed for image analysis [51]. This model\\nis analogous to the neurons in the brain and it is a normalized version of multi-layer\\nperceptrons in fully interconnected networks [52]. Speciﬁcally, the CNN consists of a single\\ninput layer, several hidden layers and a layer of output. Convolutional layers, activation\\nfunction, pooling layers and fully connected layers are structurally included in the hidden\\nlayers [53]. CNN requires much less preprocessing than other classiﬁcation algorithms and\\nproduces better results as the number of training data increases [54].\\nThe CNN structure of this study is shown in Figure 3. The input data of the input layer\\nare the normalized sample grid, and the size of each sample is 7 ×7, with four bands (four\\nmonitoring indicators). In general, the higher the number of convolution layers, the more\\nabstract features can be extracted. Because the pooling layer is usually more important\\nin target detection, this model only has two convolution layers.

The Transformation of Extremely Severe Desertiﬁcation Land Area\\nAs shown in Figure 7, the area of extremely severe desertiﬁcation land in Mu Us\\nSandy Land has decreased since 2000, compared to all other land with different levels of\\ndesertiﬁcation. Wang Tao et al. demonstrated that the change in desertiﬁcation over time,\\nbeing the pattern of change between the levels of desertiﬁcation from “desertiﬁcation to non-\\ndesertiﬁcation”, requires a long process [6]. However, since 2000, there has been no obvious\\ndecrease in the total area of desertiﬁed land in Mu Us Sandy Land, indicating that the\\nconversion of extremely severe desertiﬁed land to other desertiﬁed land is relatively active,\\nand the desertiﬁcation problem generally exhibits a reverse trend, primarily manifested as\\na decrease in the level of desertiﬁcation. Then, according to this dynamic mechanism of\\ndesertiﬁcation, the primary task of desertiﬁcation control is the governance of extremely\\nsevere desertiﬁcation.\\n4.2.3. The Ecological Restoration of Sandy Land\\nCombined with the changing trend of desertiﬁed land area and monitoring indica-\\ntors in Mu Us Sandy Land from 2000 to 2018 (Figures 7 and 10). After 2000, under the\\nbackground of a warm and humid climate, Mu Us Sandy Land has experienced a series of\\necological restoration projects and measures (i.e., the Return Grazing to Grass Program [66]\\nand the “Three-North-Shelterbelt” Project [ 10]). Desertiﬁcation has gradually been re-\\nduced, and the environment has been restored by the decrease in albedo and land surface\\ntemperature, the reduction in soil grain size and the increase in land surface greenness.\\nThis reduction in the area of desertiﬁed land in the Mu Us Sandy Land demonstrates that\\necological restoration is an effective method to control desertiﬁcation.\\n4.3. The Advantages and Limitations\\nAccording to MODIS data products, computer automatic classiﬁcation technology\\nis used to obtain high temporal resolution desertiﬁcation data set in Mu Us Sandy Land.\\nThe results in this study provide useful mechanistic insights into the monitoring of de-\\nsertiﬁcation. The multi-index multi-model reveals the optimal method of desertiﬁcation\\nmonitoring in the study area and is more advanced than using the single-index single\\nmodel and multi-index single model. We also reveal that in the arid and semi-arid desert\\nsteppe areas of northern China, the area of light desertiﬁed land ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly\\non interannual time scales depending on the weather and rainfall during a speciﬁc year.\\nThese ﬂuctuations affect the total area of desertiﬁed land and could cause discrepancies\\nin desertiﬁcation monitoring results between different studies in the same region if not\\naccounted for. Future research should quantify the potential area that is vulnerable to\\ndesertiﬁcation to obtain more accurate results. The accuracy of the optimal monitoring\\nscheme for the Mu Us Sandy Land should also be investigated for other regions.\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn this study, the spatio-temporal patterns of desertiﬁcation in the Mu Us Sandy Land\\nwere monitored with a machine learning model and multi-index remote sensing data.\\nSince 2000, the total area of desertiﬁed land has reduced in the study region, although\\nwith signiﬁcant interannual ﬂuctuation primarily driven by changes in the area of light\\ndesertiﬁed land. The Random forest (RF) model is the optimal method for monitoring\\ndesertiﬁcation in Mu Us Sandy Land using medium–low-resolution remote sensing images.\\nThe accuracy of land classiﬁcation results extracted by the combination of four monitoring\\nindicators (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) was the highest. Using the RF method and four\\nmonitoring indicators, the level of desertiﬁcation in Mu Us Sandy Land was classiﬁed with\\nan accuracy of 87.67%. However, the strong correlation between monitoring indicators\\nmay affect the classiﬁcation accuracy due to the greater the information redundancy. The\\nTGSI, which characterizes soil information, is an excellent monitoring index, while LST is\\nnot effective for classifying desertiﬁed land. The interannual variation in each index has'),\n",

Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China. However, most previous studies have used a single method or remote sensing index to monitor desertification, and lacked an efficient and high-precision monitoring system. In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial–temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators. (c) Since 2000, the area of extremely severe desertified land has shown a reversal trend; however, there is significant interannual fluctuation in the total and light desertification land area affected by extreme climate. This research provides a novel approach and a valuable reference for monitoring the evolution of desertification in regional studies, and the results improve the research system of desertification and provide a data basis for desertification cause analysis and prevention.', 'title': 'Monitoring Desertification Using Machine-Learning Techniques with Multiple Indicators Derived from MODIS Images in Mu Us Sandy Land, China', 'source': 'Monitoring_Desertification_Using_Machine-Learning_.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 18, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 2663 19 of 21\\nTable A2.

Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China.

In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial–temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators.

Introduction\\nDesertiﬁcation is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas\\nprimarily caused by human activities and climatic variations [1]. It occurs because dryland\\necosystems, which cover over one-third of the world’s land area, are extremely vulner-\\nable to overexploitation and inappropriate land use [ 2]. As one of the most important\\nenvironment–economy–society problems of the world, desertiﬁcation threatens regional\\necological security and limits economic development at national levels, accompanying de-\\nclining soil fertility and vegetation degradation [3,4].
